2025 Subaru Crosstrek 🔥

This one came in for the perfect combo: Level 1 Ceramic Coating + PRIME XR+ Tint on every window.

## Why this setup?

- **Heat protection** — XR+ keeps the cabin cool, even in Grand Junction summers.
- **Interior preservation** — blocks UV damage so your dash, seats, and plastics stay fresh.
- **Easier maintenance** — the coating keeps the paint slick, glossy, and way easier to wash.
- **Long-term protection** — better gloss, better durability, better resale.
