This 2026 Tesla Model Y received the ultimate protection package at our Grand Junction shop. The owner wanted to keep the new EV looking flawless for years to come, so we wrapped the entire front end in XPEL Ultimate+ Paint Protection Film (PPF).

## Why Protect a Tesla with PPF?

Tesla paint is known for being soft and prone to chips. XPEL Ultimate+ PPF provides:

- **Self-healing technology**: Minor scratches disappear with heat
- **10-year warranty**: No yellowing, cracking, or peeling
- **Hydrophobic surface**: Water and dirt bead off easily
- **Invisible finish**: Maintains the original look
- **UV protection**: Prevents fading and oxidation

## Coverage Areas

- Full front bumper
- Hood
- Fenders
- Headlights
- Side mirrors

## Installation Process

Our certified installers spent two days on this Tesla Model Y:

1. **Paint decontamination**: Iron remover and clay bar
2. **Surface prep**: Polishing for a flawless base
3. **PPF application**: Computer-cut patterns for a perfect fit
4. **Edge wrapping**: For seamless, invisible protection
5. **Final inspection**: Quality check and care instructions

## Results

The Model Y now has bulletproof protection against rock chips, bug splatter, and road debris. The owner can drive with confidence knowing the paint will stay looking new for years.
