This 2025 Lincoln Aviator is looking next-level after a visit to our Grand Junction shop! Here's why 👇🏼👇🏼

## Level 2 Ceramic Coating

We applied our Level 2 Ceramic Coating for:
- **Deep gloss** that makes the paint pop
- **Long-term protection** from UV, chemicals, and the elements
- **Slick hydrophobic finish** so water, dirt, and grime slide right off
- **Easy maintenance**—keeps it looking fresh every day

## XPEL Prime XR Window Tint

We also installed XPEL Prime XR ceramic tint on the two front windows:
- **Blocks heat** for a cooler cabin
- **Protects the interior** from fading and cracking
- **Maintains visibility** with a premium, non-reflective look

Premium protection + luxury SUV = perfect combo!

## Installation Process

1. **Thorough wash and decontamination**
2. **Paint correction for swirl-free finish**
3. **Multi-layer ceramic coating on all painted surfaces**
4. **XPEL Prime XR tint on front windows**
5. **Final inspection and care instructions**

## Results

The Lincoln Aviator now boasts a mirror-like gloss, stays cleaner longer, and the interior is protected from Colorado's sun. If you want your ride to stay looking brand-new for years, we’ve got you.
